# Observations_MSc
## This repository contains the code-script for the observational part.
The focus here was to create a pipeline, to analyse the real data gathered by ALMA telescope.
Later on the pipeline will be tested on simulational data and adjusted accordingly to create a more robust pipeline.
By having a robust pipeline, we can be able to analyse the simulational data as observational data to have a better understanding with much less bias.
